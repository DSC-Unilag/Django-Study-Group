Every week we would be considering 2 chapters of the book. The codes should be submitted by the participants.

How should the assignment be submitted?
-The assignment for the week should be in a folder named (firstname-lastname-week1) in that order.
-The folder would contain your project and a requirements.txt that lists all the dependencies for the project to run in a virtual environment
